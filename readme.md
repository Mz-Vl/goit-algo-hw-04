# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark

In this project, sorting algorithms are used to measure their performance on large datasets.

## Results

### For an array of 1000 elements

- Merge sort:         0.02025 sec
- Insertion sort:      0.29657 sec
- Timsort:            0.00014 sec

### For an array of 5000 elements

- Merge sort:         0.12704 sec
- Insertion sort:      7.91113 sec
- Timsort:            0.00074 sec

As seen from the results, algorithms take different amounts of time for sorting. Insertion sort appears to be the slowest, especially on large datasets, while Timsort demonstrates the best performance.
